## What I did to optimize page load time?
1. Used CSS Purge to remove unused styles.
2. Minified the build files using webpack.
3. Enabled CSS JIT so that build file is much smaller.
4. Used Netlify to host the static files which uses CDN and caches the static files.

## What else can be done to optimise the page load time?

2. Lossless image compression
